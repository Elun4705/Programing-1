#### Number Guess -
Well this is a fun one.This is as the name says, a number guessing name. The app gives you 5 tries to guess the correct number. It's not completely finished yet, so it give feedback that shouldn't be given if the correct answer if given. Try  if you dare. you have 5 to 100 chance of getting it.
#### PigLatin -
Definition

A made-up language formed from English by transferring the initial consonant or consonant cluster of each word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable, so chicken soup would be translated to ickenchay oupsay. Pig Latin is typically spoken playfully, as if to convey secrecy.

The app is not perfect yet, but it works swell. It understands most words, I use this just to play around. It's a fun way to spend time deciphering. Most people won't understand it, which is why it's used for **secrets**.
